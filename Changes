Revision history for Hash-AutoHash

1.15	2012-09-18
	Changed version number in helper package for consistency with other
	  AutoHash modules

1.14	2012-09-02
	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: no longer possible to use method notation for keys
	  with the same names as methods inherited from UNIVERSAL (the base  
	  class of everything). These are  'can', 'isa', 'DOES', and 'VERSION'.
	  The reason is that as of Perl 5.9.3, calling UNIVERSAL methods as
	  functions is deprecated and developers are encouraged to use method
	  form instead. Previous versions of AutoHash are incompatible with CPAN
	  modules that adopt this style.

1.13	2012-09-01
	Added test for version number in POD
	Changed tests to correct errors found by CPAN testers that look like
	  'deprecated use of qw(...) as parentheses' although the actual error
	  message is 'Global symbol "$test" requires explicit package name'
	Changes to Build.PL
	  Removed redundant 'dist_version_from' param
          Added Module::Build to configure_requires
	  Changed create_makefile_pl from deprecated 'passthrough' to 'small'

1.12    2010-03-01
	Added perl 5.8.3 as prerequisite. needed by autohash_empty and 
	  autohash_notempty when operating on a tied hash. these functions test
	  for emptiness by referencing the hash in scalar context. this doesn't
	  work in perls prior to 5.8.3. thanks to CPAN smoke testers for
	  finding this!

1.11    2010-02-23
	Minor documentation cleanup and reformatting

1.10    2009-10-30
	This should be stable release assuming CPAN testers find no problems
        Refactored perl 5.10 dependent test code
	Reversed order of revisions in this file
	
1.02	2009-10-29
	Documentation changes only. 
	  Changed module names AVP_Single, AVP_Multi to AVPairsSingle, AVPairsMulti
          in SEE ALSO to better match CPAN naming style

1.01	2009-10-28
	Fixed 'make test' - bug found by CPAN testers.
	Fixed version number failure in testson perl 5.10 - bug found by CPAN testers.
	Added DOES to special methods delegated to base class. Needed for perl 5.10, since
	  DOES added to methods inherited from UNIVERSAL.

1.00    2009-10-26
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
