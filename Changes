Revision history for Hash-AutoHash

1.12    2010-03-01
	Added perl 5.8.3 as prerequisite. needed by autohash_empty and 
	  autohash_notempty when operating on a tied hash. these functions test
	  for emptiness by referencing the hash in scalar context. this doesn't
	  work in perls prior to 5.8.3. thanks to CPAN smoke testers for
	  finding this!
